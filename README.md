## Description
- Sometimes it is hard to keep track of all of your employees, who is on your team, and the best ways to contact them. This application will generate an html page with all of the entered data for the manager and each employee on the team.
- I learned how to better write class constructors, super constructors, using jest for testing, how to generate an HTML file with object-oriented programming.
